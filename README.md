**Take steps before others to attain an object**
Imagine people having the same thing in common; however, this thing can only belong to one person. This game was made to turn these people into players. Each player would take random steps by competing with other rivals. Before the game begins, the players would decide the total steps needed to take to get to the destination, where the object is located as well as the object name. The winner is determined if a player has accumulated the exact steps specified by all the players.
